# **App Name**: SportBet Replica

## Core Features:

- Homepage Clone: Replicate the exact layout, design, and interactive elements of the sportbet.ec homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within a Next.js environment, focusing on responsive design.
- Sportsbook Listing: Duplicate the presentation of sports and betting markets, including odds display, event categorization, and real-time updates (simulated with randomized test data) in the web app.
- Bet Slip Simulation: Develop a functional bet slip area allowing users to add, remove, and modify selections, mirroring the original site's behavior but using client-side state management.
- Navigation Replication: Mirror the site's navigation structure, ensuring all links and interactive components navigate within the replicated environment.
- Promotions Carousel: Implement a carousel showcasing betting promotions. The content will initially be static and based on information scraped from sportbet.ec for demonstration.
- UI Parity Check Tool: Use a generative AI powered "tool" that analyzes screenshots of sportbet.ec to make suggestions about how to improve the replica's alignment to the original.
